This was one of the first *Open Source* projects for a broader audience, written 1976 by
[Li-Chen Wang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Chen_Wang) who coined the term *"Copyleft"*
to describe his concept. *Tiny BASIC* was created as a reaction to Bill Gates'
[An Open Letter to Hobbyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists)
in which Gates emphasised his view that hobbyists who copied his *Altair BASIC*
interpreter software were stealing from him personally.

*Tiny BASIC* uses 16bit signed integer arithmetic with the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
and nested parantheses, has 26 staticly assigned variables `A` to `Z` and one dynamic
array `@` that occupies the remaining free RAM space. 

*Tiny BASIC* can be build with the [zmac](https://github.com/gp48k/zmac) assembler.

### Z80-MBC2 version `tinybasic8080.asm`

The I/O functions `ROUTC` and `CHKIO` and the memory size were modified for the `iLoad` command of the
[Z80-MBC2](https://github.com/Ho-Ro/Z80-MBC2). I made some formatting changes w/o functional impact.
