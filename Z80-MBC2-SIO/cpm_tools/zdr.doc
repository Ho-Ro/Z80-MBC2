ZDR is a small ( <7 records, <1k ), but complete disk directory 
program, meant for situations where conservation of disk space is 
of value.  Its small size, and horiZontal format (the Z in ZDR) 
are suited to the screen of the portable Epson Geneva PX-8.

ZDR can also be called with    A>zdr B:   or   A>zdr D4:   and 
will recognize these CPM-style and ZCPR-style requests for disk
areas and disk id's.  If ZDR is asked for a directory of another 
user area, it will list the files in that disk/area only, with 
their correct sizes.  ZDR should work with any floppy 
disk/ramdisk/rom chip setup which uses CPM v2.2 protocols to 
define disk space.  It will deal correctly with files up to 255k 
in size, and with disks having up to 1000k of total space.  ZDR
senses the data block size (some disks use 1k, fewer 2k, very few 
4k, and so on) and adjusts its calculations to take account of 
the disk space allocation protocols.  The directory is 
alphabetized and presented in order from upper left to lower 
right.

ZDR's small size suggests that it might be useful for inclusion
in other programs which need directory functions.  It is more
sophisticated than most "internal" directories in its provision
for file size statistics and alphabetization, yet small enough
to add only a small bulge to a modem program or text processor.
The assembly language for ZDR, ZDR.ASM, should also be found
in this area if you wish to use ZDR in this way.  If you install
ZDR in another program, note that it builds a directory table 
upward from its own last address, potentially overwriting the 
next k or so above.

There are many excellent directory programs available, but if
you keep a directory program on every floppy disk, you'll save
2-3k/disk for other files if that directory program is ZDR.
